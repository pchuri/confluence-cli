I have analyzed the codebase and identified several inconsistencies between the `README.md` documentation and the actual implementation of the CLI tool. I have addressed these issues by modifying the code to be more robust and by updating the documentation to be accurate and comprehensive.

Here is a summary of the changes:

1.  **`update` Command Logic and Documentation:**
    *   **Inconsistency:** The `README.md` suggested that updating a page's title without changing its content was possible. However, the implementation in `bin/confluence.js` incorrectly threw an error if the `--content` or `--file` flags were not provided, making title-only updates impossible.
    *   **Fix:**
        *   I modified the `updatePage` function in `lib/confluence-client.js` to check if new content is provided. If not, it now fetches and re-uses the existing page content, preventing accidental data loss during title-only updates.
        *   I adjusted the validation logic in `bin/confluence.js` for the `update` command to only require that at least one of `--title`, `--content`, or `--file` is present.
        *   I updated the `README.md` to include an explicit example of a title-only update.

2.  **Incomplete `README.md` Command Reference:**
    *   **Inconsistency:** The main command table in the `README.md` was missing several important commands that were fully implemented in the code, including `create`, `create-child`, `update`, `edit`, and `find`.
    *   **Fix:** I expanded the command table in `README.md` to include all available commands and their respective options, providing a complete and accurate reference for users.

3.  **Misleading `read` Command URL Examples:**
    *   **Inconsistency:** The documentation for the `read` command provided examples using "display" or "pretty" URLs. The `extractPageId` function in the code, however, explicitly does not support this URL format and can only parse URLs that contain a `pageId` query parameter (e.g., `.../viewpage.action?pageId=12345`).
    *   **Fix:** I removed the incorrect URL examples from the `README.md` and replaced them with a valid example that uses the `pageId` parameter. I also added a note to clarify that this is the only supported URL format for the `read` command.

These changes have brought the code and documentation into alignment, fixed a bug in the update functionality, and improved the overall user experience by providing clearer and more accurate instructions.
